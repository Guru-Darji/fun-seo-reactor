# Fun Search Engine Optimization Reactor
    Guru Darji

## Description:

So in this project I was given a website that was unoptimized for search enigines. My job was to refine the code enough that it would be better suit for the search engine to pick up on and spread on the web. I was able to clean up the repetive code that would hinder a seach engine and made it so it would do all the same functions but with less code and fster picture load times.
